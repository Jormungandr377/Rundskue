# Vulnerability Management Policy

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how vulnerabilities are identified, classified, and remediated in Finance Tracker. It establishes scanning practices, severity classifications, and patch SLAs to ensure timely response to security issues.

---

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning

### 2.1 Automated Scanning

The following scans run automatically via GitHub Actions:

| Scanner | Scope | Schedule | Trigger |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| **pip-audit** | Python dependency CVEs | Weekly (Monday) | Also on push/PR to main |
| **npm audit** | Node.js dependency CVEs | Weekly (Monday) | Also on push/PR to main |
| **Bandit** | Python SAST (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, etc.) | Weekly (Monday) | Also on push/PR to main |
| **Trivy** | Docker image scan (OS + library vulnerabilities) | Weekly (Monday) | Also on push/PR to main |

### 2.2 Scan Results

- Scan results are available as GitHub Actions artifacts.
- Failed scans do not block deployment but produce visible warnings in the CI pipeline.
- The maintainer reviews scan results weekly as part of the regular maintenance cycle.

### 2.3 Manual Review

In addition to automated scanning:
- Dependency updates are reviewed when Dependabot or similar tools flag new advisories.
- The Sentry error monitoring dashboard is checked regularly for unusual patterns that could indicate exploitation attempts.

## 3. Severity Classification

Vulnerabilities are classified using the following severity levels, aligned with CVSS scoring:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description | Examples |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | 9.0–10.0 | Actively exploitable, remote code execution, data breach risk | RCE in dependencies, SQL injection, auth bypass |
| **High** | 7.0–8.9 | Significant impact, likely exploitable | XSS, CSRF bypass, privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure |
| **Medium** | 4.0–6.9 | Moderate impact, requires specific conditions | Information disclosure, denial of service, weak crypto |
| **Low** | 0.1–3.9 | Minimal impact, difficult to exploit | Minor info leaks, cosmetic issues, non-default configs |

---

## 4. Patch SLAs

Once a vulnerability is identified and confirmed, it must be remediated within the following timeframes:

| Severity | Patch SLA | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Critical** | 72 hours | Drop everything. Patch, test, deploy immediately. |
| **High** | 7 days | Prioritize in current work cycle. |
| **Medium** | 30 days | Schedule for next maintenance window. |
| **Low** | Next release | Address in the normal development cadence. |

### 4.1 SLA Exceptions

If a patch cannot be applied within the SLA (e.g., no upstream fix available):
1. Document the vulnerability and the reason for delay.
2. Implement compensating controls if possible (e.g., WAF rules, feature flags, input validation).
3. Monitor for exploitation attempts via Sentry and audit logs.
4. Re-evaluate at each weekly review until resolved.

---

## 5. Patch Process

### 5.1 Dependency Vulnerabilities

1. **Identify**: Automated scanner flags a CVE in a dependency.
2. **Assess**: Determine if the vulnerability is reachable in Finance Tracker's code (not all CVEs in dependencies are exploitable in every context).
3. **Update**: Bump the affected package to a patched version in `requirements.txt` or `package.json`.
4. **Test**: Run the CI pipeline (backend tests, frontend build, security scans).
5. **Deploy**: Push to main, which triggers auto-deployment via Coolify.
6. **Verify**: Confirm the vulnerability no longer appears in the next scan.

### 5.2 Application Vulnerabilities

1. **Identify**: Found via Bandit scan, manual review, or external report.
2. **Assess**: Determine severity and exploitability.
3. **Fix**: Implement the code fix on a branch.
4. **Test**: Run full CI pipeline and manual verification.
5. **Deploy**: Merge to main and auto-deploy.
6. **Verify**: Confirm the fix is effective.

---

## 6. Tracking

- Vulnerabilities are tracked as GitHub Issues with the `security` label.
- Each issue includes: severity, affected component, CVE ID (if applicable), SLA deadline, and remediation status.
- Closed issues serve as the historical record of remediation.

---

## 7. Responsible Disclosure

If external security researchers discover vulnerabilities:
- Reports should be sent to `rundskue@outlook.com`.
- The maintainer will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- Findings will be assessed and remediated according to the SLAs above.
- There is no formal bug bounty program at this time, but responsible disclosure is appreciated and will be acknowledged.
